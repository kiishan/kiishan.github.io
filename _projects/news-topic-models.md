We live in a world where streams of data are continuously collected. Searching for insights from the collected information can therefore become very tedious and time-consuming. Topic modeling was designed as a tool to organize, search, and understand vast quantities of textual information.

In general, each document refers to a continuous set of words, like a paragraph or an article, where each article contains a set of words.
